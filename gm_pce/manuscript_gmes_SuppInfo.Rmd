###Description of the calculation of *g*~m~ from carbon isotope discrimination during C3 photosynthesis
\
Using online C isotope discrimination measurements, the difference between the observed discrimination and what is predicted for light saturated gas exchange is proportional to *g*~m~ [@griffiths2013mesophyll]. First, leaf C isotope discrimination was calculated by comparing the isotopic composition of the reference gas entering the leaf cuvette ($\delta$^13^C~e~) with the sample gas ($\delta$^13^C~o~) such that:

\
(1)
$$\delta = \left(\frac{R_s}{R_{stnd}} -1\right)1000$$

where R~s~ is the isotopic ratio of the sample and R~stnd~ is the isotopic ratio of the standard Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDP). Next, the observed discrimination ($\Delta$~o~) is calculated from Evans et al. [-@evans1986carbon]:

\
(2)
$$\Delta_{o} = \frac{\xi(\delta^13C_o-\delta^13C_e)}{1000+\delta^13C_e-\xi(\delta^13C_o-\delta^13C_e)}$$

where:

\
(3)
$$\xi = \frac{C_{e}}{C_{e}-C_{o}}$$

and $\xi$ is the ratio of the CO~2~ entering the well mixed leaf cuvette to the CO~2~ draw down in the gas stream by the leaf.

\
Second, C isotope discrimination during C~3~ photosynthesis ($\Delta$) is the resultant discrimination from CO~2~ diffusion from the atmosphere to the site of carboxylation, consisting of a series of fractionation steps described in Evans et al. [-@evans1986carbon]. In this experiment, a modified form of the equation presented in Evans & von Caemmerer [-@evans2013temperature] with ternary effect corrections by Farquhar & Cernusak [-@farquhar2012ternary] was used such that:

\
(4)
$$\Delta_o = \Delta_i - \Delta_{gm} - \Delta_e - \Delta_f$$

where $\Delta$~o~ is the observed discrimination and  $\Delta$~i~, $\Delta$~gm~ , $\Delta$~e~ and $\Delta$~f~ are the contributions to fractionation if *C*~i~ = *C*~c~, *g*~m~, respiration and photorespiration, respectively. The equations for each are as follows:

\
(5)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_i = &\frac{1}{1-t}a'+\frac{1}{1-t}((1+t)b-a')\frac{C_i}{C_a}
\end{aligned}
$$

\
(6)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{gm} = &\frac{1+t}{1-t}\left(b-a_i-\frac{eR_d}{A+R_d}\right)\frac{A}{g_mC_a}
\end{aligned}
$$

\
(7)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_e = &\frac{1+t}{1-t}\left(\frac{eR_d}{(A+R_d)C_a}(C_i-\Gamma_*)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

\
(8)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_f = & \frac{1+t}{1-t}\left(f\frac{\Gamma_*}{C_a}\right)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where the different fractionation factors include; diffusion through water (a~i~, 1.8&permil;), Rubisco carboxylation (b, 29&permil;), the photorespiratory fractionation (f, 16.2&permil;) and the combined fractionation through the boundary layer and the stomata (a'). a' is defined by:

\
(9)
$$a' = \frac{a_b(C_a-C_i)+a(C_s-C_i)}{C_a-C_i}$$

where C~s~ is the CO~2~ partial pressure at the leaf surface, a~b~ is the fractionation from boundary layer diffusion (2.9&permil;) and a is the fractionation due to diffusion in air (4.4&permil;) [@evans1986carbon]. *C*~a~ and *C*~i~ are the atmospheric and intercellular partial pressures and $\Gamma_{*}$ is the compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration in the light (R~d~). In this experiment both $\Gamma_{*}$ and R~d~ were derived using a standard Arrhenius function with parameters for *Eucalyptus globulus* from Crous et al. [-@crous2012light]. The ternary effect corrections (t) are described by:

\
(10)
$$t = \frac{(1+a')E}{2g^t_{ac}}$$

where E denotes the transpiration rate and $\text{g}^t_{ac}$ is the total conductance to CO~2~ diffusion to both the boundary layer and stomatal conductance.

\
The *g*~m~ can then be calculated as:

\
(11)
$$
\begin{aligned}
g_m = \left(\frac{1+t}{1-t}\left(b-a_i-\frac{eR_d}{A+R_d}\right)\frac{A}{C_a}\right) / \left(\Delta_i-\Delta_o-\Delta_e-\Delta_f\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, *g*~m~ is expressed in units of mol m^-2^ s^-1^ bar^-1^ to be consistent with Evans & von Caemmerer [-@evans2013temperature]. As the pressure term is nearly equal to unity, suitable comparisons between *g*~m~ and *g*~s~ can be made.

##Methods S2

###Photosynthetic parameters from A-*C*~i~ curves
From each A-*C*~i~ curve the photosynthetic parameters, *J*~max~ and *V*~cmax~, were quantified using the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. [-@farquhar1980biochemical]. We used the 'fitaci' function in the 'plantecophys' package in R, see Duursma [-@duursma2015] for detailed description of the fitting methods. This method uses non-linear regression to estimate *J*~max~, *V*~cmax~ and *R*~dark~ simultaneously. Because there was considerable practical difficulty in fitting A-*C*~c~ curves, we report standard *C*~i~-based *J*~max~ and *V*~cmax~, which effectively include a mesophyll conductance component. When fitting the A-*C*~i~ curves, we calculated $\Gamma_{*}$ with the same methods as for *g*~m~, described above (the estimated value at 25&deg;C was 38.9 $\mu$mol mol^-1^), and the combined Michaelis-Menten coefficient (*K*~m~) was estimated from Medlyn et al. [-@medlyn2002temperature] (713.4 $\mu$mol mol^-1^ at 25&deg;C, using a *K*~c~ of 405 $\mu$mol mol^-1^, with an atmospheric pressure of 100 kPa). The temperature response parameters for *J*~max~, *V*~cmax~ and *K*~m~ are not relevant since *T*~leaf~ was kept constant at 25&deg;C.
