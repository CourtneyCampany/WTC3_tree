* Figure 1. Here is the light environment in which gas exchange measurements for sun and shade leaves were measured.  

This data was generated with a handheld par sensor for each individual leaf and verified with ceptometer readings within the canopy at the height of the measured leaf. There was a ~75% reduction in PPFD from sun to shave leaves.

* ACi curves were measured at saturating light for both sun and shade leaves. Both Vc<sub>max</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> are reduced in shade leaves with little effect of the temperature treatment(AT/ET). ACi curves were taken once towards the end of the experiment on well watered trees
